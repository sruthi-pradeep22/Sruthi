    <h1><u>Frontend</u></h1>
    <P>Front-end development involves the development of the visual and interactive components of a website or application that users interact with. This is managed by Front-end developers who use programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and implement User Interfaces (UI) that are easy to use and navigate.</P>
    <br>
    <P>Front-end development requires a diverse set of skills, including design, programming, and testing. To ensure that designs are responsive and function smoothly across all devices and screen sizes, Front-end developers must have a good understanding of User Experience (UX) design principles. The ultimate goal is to provide very clean and smooth user interactions to the end users.</P>
    <br>
    <p>Frameworks and technologies such as React, Angular, and Vue have become integral parts of Front-end web development in recent years. In general, Front-end development is a critical aspect of building user-friendly websites and applications.</p>
